    "A probability is a number that represents the **likelihood** of an uncertain event. Probabilities are always **between 0 and 1**, inclusive. The larger the probability, the more likely the event is to happen. A probability of 0 means that the event is impossible; it will never happen. A probability of 1 means that the event is assured; it will always happen. All other values between 0 and 1 represent various levels of likelihood."
